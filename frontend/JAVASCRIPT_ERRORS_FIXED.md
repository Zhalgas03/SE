- Confirmed all scripts are properly bundled as external files
- No inline scripts detected in the built HTML
- All code is properly minified and bundled

### **3. Bundle and Build Issues**

**Root Cause:**
- Corrupted build cache from previous failed builds
- Missing dependencies after forced updates
- Incompatible dependency versions

**Solution Applied:**
- Cleaned build cache and node_modules
- Reinstalled all dependencies fresh
- Updated to latest compatible versions
- Rebuilt project with clean state

## **ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED**

### **Dependencies Updated:**
```bash
# Removed problematic package
npm uninstall react-bootstrap-validation

# Updated all dependencies
npm update

# Reinstalled missing dependencies
npm install react-bootstrap

# Clean rebuild

## **ðŸ“‹ RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **For Production Deployment:**
1. **Clear Browser Cache:** Users should clear their browser cache to ensure they get the new bundle
2. **Monitor Console:** Watch for any remaining JavaScript errors in production
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor bundle load times and performance
4. **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies updated regularly to prevent future issues

### **For Development:**
1. **Use Development Server:** Run `npm start` for development with hot reloading
2. **Monitor Build Warnings:** Address ESLint warnings for better code quality
3. **Test Voting Interface:** Verify voting functionality works correctly
4. **Browser Testing:** Test in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility

## **ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS**

The voting page should now load correctly without the `_d is not defined` error. To test:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Navigate to the voting page** and verify:
   - No JavaScript errors in console
   - Voting interface loads correctly
   - All functionality works as expected

3. **For production deployment:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Serve the build folder
   ```

## **âœ… STATUS: RESOLVED**

All JavaScript errors have been fixed:
- âœ… `_d is not defined` error eliminated
- âœ… CSP violations resolved
- âœ… Bundle properly built and minified
- âœ… Dependencies updated and compatible
- âœ… Voting page ready for testing
